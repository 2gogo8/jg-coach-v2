# V2 實驗室 — 進化日誌

## 目標
每小時模擬學生使用、反思體驗、自動改善、測試部署。
執行至 2026/02/22 11:00 Taipei time。

## V2 現狀 (2026/02/22 01:30)
- **Pages**: Homepage (public feed), Auth, Admin, Student/[id]
- **APIs**: auth, register, insights, weekly-direction, trades, trades/upload, questions, questions/answer, questions/public, students/[id], admin/students, admin/stock-stats, stock-queries, leaderboard, missions, ocr
- **Features**: Gamification (XP, levels, badges, streaks, leaderboard, missions), OCR trade upload (Tesseract.js), question system, weekly direction, stock queries, bottom tab nav
- **Theme**: Dark navy + blue + amber, glass morphism
- **Stack**: Next.js 16.1.6 (Turbopack), Tailwind CSS
- **No FMP integration yet** — needs .env.local with API key
- **In-memory store** — data resets on cold start

## Evolution Rounds

### Round 1 (2026/02/22 01:30 → 03:00 Taipei)

**Student Flow Simulation:**
- ✅ Homepage → Auth → Student Dashboard
- ✅ Tested trade creation flow
- ✅ Tested FMP stock validation (AAPL, Apple Inc.)
- ✅ Verified toast notifications
- ✅ Confirmed improved empty states

**Critical UX Issues Identified & Fixed:**

1. **❌ No Stock Price Validation → ✅ FMP Integration**
   - Created `lib/fmp.ts` with FMP API client using `/stable/` endpoints
   - Added `/api/stock-price` endpoint for real-time quote lookup
   - Auto-fill current price when valid symbol entered
   - Real-time validation feedback: "✓ Apple Inc." (green) or "找不到此股票代號" (red)
   - **Impact:** Students get instant validation, reducing errors and building confidence

2. **❌ No Feedback After Trade Submission → ✅ Toast Notification System**
   - Created `lib/toast.tsx` component with auto-dismiss (3s)
   - Success/error variants with icons
   - **Impact:** Clear confirmation that action succeeded, better UX flow

3. **❌ Weak Empty States → ✅ Actionable CTAs**
   - Changed "還沒有紀錄" → "開始你的交易日記，追蹤每一次成長"
   - Added direct "記錄第一筆交易" button in empty state
   - **Impact:** More encouraging, reduces friction for first-time users

**Technical Details:**
- FMP API Key configured in Vercel environment: `FMP_API_KEY`
- Using `/stable/quote?symbol=X` endpoint (new stable API)
- Price auto-fill only when field is empty (preserves manual edits)
- Symbol validation triggers on `onBlur` event
- Toast auto-dismiss after 3000ms
- All TypeScript types verified (`npx tsc --noEmit`)

**Deployment:**
- Commit: `7dec3cd` (feat(evolution-1): FMP integration + toast notifications + improved UX)
- Production: `https://jg-coach-v2.vercel.app`
- Build: ✅ Successful
- Verification: ✅ All features tested in production

**Metrics:**
- Files changed: 6 (+4 new)
- Lines added: ~236
- Build time: ~15s
- New API endpoint: 1 (`/api/stock-price`)

**What's Next (Round 2 ideas):**
- Add recent price change indicator (%, arrow up/down)
- Pre-populate common symbols as suggestions
- Add batch import from broker screenshot
- Improve leaderboard engagement
- Add weekly performance summary charts

### Round 2 (2026/02/22 02:00 → 02:30 Taipei)

**Planning (Based on Round 1 Feedback):**
Prioritized 3 improvements from "What's Next" list:
1. Price change indicators (real-time market sentiment)
2. Quick symbol suggestions (reduce friction for beginners)
3. Public activity feed (boost community engagement)

**Improvements Implemented:**

1. **✅ Real-Time Price Change Indicators**
   - Display stock price movement (▲/▼ + %) alongside validation
   - Green for positive, red for negative
   - Example: `✓ Apple Inc. ▲ +2.34%` or `✓ Tesla ▼ -1.52%`
   - Uses existing FMP data (`changesPercentage` from `/stable/quote`)
   - **Impact:** Students see immediate market context when logging trades

2. **✅ Quick Symbol Suggestions**
   - Pre-filled buttons for popular symbols when input is empty
   - US market: AAPL, TSLA, NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN
   - TW market: 2330, 2454, 2317, 2412, 2303, 2308
   - One-tap to auto-fill and fetch price
   - **Impact:** New users don't need to remember tickers, faster workflow

3. **✅ Public Activity Feed on Homepage**
   - Shows last 8 trades across all students
   - Displays: action (buy/sell), symbol, market, price, date
   - Animated entrance for each item
   - **Impact:** Creates sense of community, shows platform is active

**Technical Details:**
- Extended TradeModal state: `priceChange`, `priceChangePercent`
- API `/api/stock-price` already returns these fields (no backend change)
- Quick suggestions adapt to selected market (US/TW)
- Homepage pulls trades via existing `/api/trades` endpoint
- All changes client-side only (app/student/[id]/page.tsx, app/page.tsx)
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ No errors

**Deployment:**
- Commit: `ca4571d` (feat(evolution-2): price change indicators + quick symbol suggestions + public activity feed)
- Production: `https://jg-coach-v2.vercel.app`
- Build time: ~14s (Turbopack)
- Vercel deployment: ✅ Successful

**Metrics:**
- Files changed: 3 (app/student/[id]/page.tsx, app/page.tsx, no new files)
- Lines added: ~94
- New components: 0 (reused existing UI patterns)
- API changes: 0 (utilized existing endpoints)

**Next Round Ideas (Round 3):**
- Add monthly comparison chart on student dashboard
- Implement leaderboard view (currently API exists but no dedicated page)
- Add "hot stocks" widget showing most-traded symbols today
- Improve mobile responsiveness for trade modal
- Add bulk trade import from CSV
